### Simulating-learning-in-the-nectar-foraging-behaviour-of-Helicoverpa-armigera
This report is focused on simulating the empirical results obtained by Cunningham et. al. [1,2] which show that H. armigera had a significant bias towards host selection if they had previous experience on a particular host plant. The proposed model is a novel learning mechanism based on a 1-D dynamical system simulated with a stochastic process. The results of stochastic simulation of the proposed mechanism, for hypothetical learning in moths show that a simple dynamical system could produce effective results that resemble the empirical evidence. It could be sufficient to explain the empirical data without assuming very complex learning mechanisms.
